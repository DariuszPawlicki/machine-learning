| Files | Description |
|--|--|
| [AlexNet Notebook](https://github.com/DariuszPawlicki/machine-learning/blob/master/AlexNet.ipynb), [Source Code](https://github.com/DariuszPawlicki/machine-learning/blob/master/alexnet.py) | Implementation of famous Convolutional Neural Network, which outperformed rivals in LSVRC-2012.|
| [ResNet Notebook](https://github.com/DariuszPawlicki/machine-learning/blob/master/ResNet.ipynb), [Source Code](https://github.com/DariuszPawlicki/machine-learning/blob/master/resnet.py)| Implementation of ResNet, milestone in training very deep networks.|
| [GAN Notebook](https://github.com/DariuszPawlicki/machine-learning/blob/master/GenerativeAdversarialNetwork.ipynb), [Source Code](https://github.com/DariuszPawlicki/machine-learning/blob/master/gan.py)| Implementation of basic GAN presented in Ian Goodfellow paper.|
| [DCGAN Notebook](https://github.com/DariuszPawlicki/machine-learning/blob/master/DCGAN.ipynb) | DCGAN, in opposite to vanilla GAN, makes use of convolutional layers and few tricks what stabilizes training and allows generate better samples from more complex data - such as CIFAR-10. |
